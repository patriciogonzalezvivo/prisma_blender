This repository includes a Blender file that allows you make a basic 3D model reconstruction from a [PRISMA](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/prisma) folder.

The daya needs first to be process using [PRISMA](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/prisma)

Then the `rgba.png` and `depth_<model>.png` needs to be swaped.

As long the this files are relative to the `blend` file you will be able to see the model in Blender when is in the same folder.
